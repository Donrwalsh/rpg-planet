- [ ] Learn more about the physics engine
  - [ ] An apparent next task would be to create **Field** where the NPC is an `EngineObject` but the floor is part of the level. The single NPC's behavior is based on the environment around it. Feet need to be on the ground to move forward and movement stops when there is something attackable within melee (touch range to start, think super basic starter NPC). Consider adding the scroll element to end the game.
- [x] Sprites? How that interplays with physics and representing my current, simple ideas.
- [x]d Take what I learned about sprites and apply them to the blue boxes. Walking animation while strolling and then attack animation once it reaches the wall. Just do one npc to start with.
- [ ] Look back into the sprite atlas now that I know how this works kinda

- [ ] Could use an example of how to spread code across multiple js files.
- [ ] Add a range check to the basic npc attack.
- [ ] Would be cool to show some damage numbers on screen.
- [x] How about changing around the way sprites are chosen so that they don't all sync up?
- [ ] How about adding multiple walls?
- [ ] Let's update the current only sprite to be more generic and starter than it is currently. Maybe no weapon for the absolute lack of range.
