- The lineage system could be bound to a single game. When an NPC dies, they (or their offspring) return with modified stats based on how they originally died. Hm.
- Range system for NPCs. What I have now uses collision as a stand-in for melee-distance threat of an attackable object. Should probably work to decouple those.
- This threat concept could be clever. Have NPCs hold and carry multiple types of weapons. They choose which weapon to use based on availability of potential targets.
- Using color to indicate class. Dip into color theory for overlap? Could be sweet.
- NPCs could drop items they are carrying and that's what's turned into other resources. . .
