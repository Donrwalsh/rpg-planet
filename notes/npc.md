## Properties

### Characteristics

Core characteristics of the NPC. These are established once and never change.

- Gender
- Faction/Kingdom
- Class

### Class

Each NPC has one class. Classes are alliteratively tiered:

| Tier 0 | Tier 1   | Tier 2    | Tier 3   | _(Stat Focus)_ |
| ------ | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Pleb   | Soldier  | Cavalier  | Warrior  | _Strength_     |
|        | Scout    | Charlatan | Wanderer | _Speed_        |
|        | Sorcerer | Cleric    | Wizard   | _Smarts_       |

#### Pleb

Core starter class. Each Tier 1 class builds upon the basics represented by this class. Tier 2 and 3 may not follow this pattern but still represent an advancement from the previous tier.

### Stats

**Core Stats**

- Strength
- Speed
- Smarts

Attributes of the NPC which influence gameplay results. These are established in accordance to the NPC's characteristics and are influenced by other sources as well.

**Level**

- Level

Level is like a stat but it is unique in that it can change instantaneously when an NPC levels up, resulting in a cascade effect that may directly modify other stats 'permanently'.

### Equipment

NPCs may carry equipment that enhance their capabilities. Upon defeat, this equipment turns into loot. All NPCs have three main equipment slots, certain NPCs have additional slots which contain rarer equipment/loot.

- _Main_ - Weapon
- _Main_ - Outfit
- _Main_ - Other
- _Specialist_ - Shield
- _Specialist_ - Pockets
- _Specialist_ - Enchantment
- ...

# Old 2d Ideas

## Classes:

At the start, each NPC is one of three classes:

- Warrior (_Red_)
  - Warriors deal damage up close with short-range weapons.
  - Low dps but bulky and hard to kill.
- Mage (_Blue_)
  - Mages deal damage from afar with magical spells.
  - High damage but fragile and easy to dispatch.
- Rogue (_Yellow_)
  - Rogues keep you guessing. They can deal damage up close or from afar.
  - Medium damage and survivability. Unpredictable. They have tricky ways to avoid danger.

Later on, players may encounter NPCs that are of combined classes:

- Cleric (_Green_)
  - Rogue + Mage hybrid. Specializes in supporting allies with powerful heals and buffs.
- Ranger (_Orange_)
  - Rogue + Warrior hybrid.
- Knight (_Purple_)
  - Warrior + Mage hybrid.

## Sprites:

These are all the sprites I need to represent a basic NPC:

- Left-Walk
- Left-Run
- Left-Jump
- Left-Slash (Warrior)
- Left-Shoot (Rogue)
- Left-Spellcast (Mage)
