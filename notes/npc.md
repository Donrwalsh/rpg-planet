## Classes:

At the start, each NPC is one of three classes:

- Warrior (_Red_)
  - Warriors deal damage up close with short-range weapons.
  - Low dps but bulky and hard to kill.
- Mage (_Blue_)
  - Mages deal damage from afar with magical spells.
  - High damage but fragile and easy to dispatch.
- Rogue (_Yellow_)
  - Rogues keep you guessing. They can deal damage up close or from afar.
  - Medium damage and survivability. Unpredictable. They have tricky ways to avoid danger.

Later on, players may encounter NPCs that are of combined classes:

- Cleric (_Green_)
  - Rogue + Mage hybrid. Specializes in supporting allies with powerful heals and buffs.
- Ranger (_Orange_)
  - Rogue + Warrior hybrid.
- Knight (_Purple_)
  - Warrior + Mage hybrid.

## Sprites:

These are all the sprites I need to represent a basic NPC:

- Left-Walk
- Left-Run
- Left-Jump
- Left-Slash (Warrior)
- Left-Shoot (Rogue)
- Left-Spellcast (Mage)
